<h3>Technical Assessment using JAVA</h3>
The next step in the Code2040 application process is the Technical Assessment. 
The Technical Assessment is an API challenge with the goal of showcasing our coding abilities by completing 5 programming challenges presented by Code2040. In order to complete this challenge I chose to use the JAVA programming language and Android Studio to create an Android mobile application.
